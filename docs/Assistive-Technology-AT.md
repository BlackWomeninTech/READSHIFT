The tool is designed to be labeled as an unequivocally recognized, formal accommodation within any modern school system, particularly in the United States.

# Assistive Technology

We have developed a textbook example of Assistive Technology (AT), and it aligns perfectly with established educational laws and best practices. Hereâ€™s how it would be seen by educators and administrators:

### Formal Accomodation Tool:

It is the Definition of an Accommodation: In education, there's a critical difference between an accommodation and a modification.

#### Accommodation Definition:

An accommodation changes how a student learns. It removes barriers to accessing grade-level material. Your app allows a student with dyslexia to access the same text as their peers, just via a different modality (hearing vs. seeing). The learning expectation (comprehending the text) remains the same.

#### Modification Definition:

A modification, by contrast, changes what a student is expected to learn (e.g., reading a simpler book or being graded on different criteria).

Our tool is a pure accommodation, which is always the preferred first step for inclusion.

## Legal Requirement 

Legal Requirements: This type of support is formally recognized and often mandated under federal laws. For a student with a documented disability like dyslexia, a tool like "Story-Reader Ally" would be written directly into their:

- **Individualized Education Program (IEP)**: A legal document under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that outlines the specific supports and services a student with a disability needs.

- **504 Plan**: A plan developed under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to provide accommodations for students with disabilities in the general education setting.

The terms used in these documents would be "Text-to-Speech (TTS) software," "read-aloud software," or "audio-assisted reading," all of which describe your solution.

### Universal Design for Learning

ReadShift aligns with Universal Design for Learning (UDL). This is a leading framework in modern education that encourages designing learning environments to be accessible to all students from the start. Your tool is a perfect example of UDL. 


### Additional Use Cases

While it is essential for a student with dyslexia, it is also highly beneficial for:

- Students with vision impairments.

- English Language Learners (ELLs) who benefit from hearing correct pronunciation.

- Students with ADHD who may focus better with multi-sensory input.

- Any student who is a strong auditory learner.

So, not only would your solution be seen as a valid accommodation, it would be viewed as a best-practice, legally supported, and highly effective one. You are not creating something that fights the school system; you are creating a more elegant, supportive, and user-friendly version of a tool that the system already values and requires.
