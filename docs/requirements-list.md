# Project: READSHIFT

## Submission Requirements

You will submit a <strong>Writeup </strong> to one of the hackathonâ€™s tracks which should minimally include:

- The <strong>Video Demo (3 minutes or less): </strong>This is the most important part of your submission. Create a dynamic, engaging, and high-quality video that demonstrates your project in action.

    - <strong>Your Goal: </strong> Tell a story. Show us the problem and how your Gemma 3n app solves it in a powerful way.

    - <strong>Format: </strong> You can post your video to YouTube, X (Twitter), TikTok, or any other public platform. You will provide a direct link to the video. It must be viewable by the judges without requiring a login.

- <strong> The Technical Writeup (The Proof of Work): </strong>
This paper - or blog-style report is your technical verification. It must clearly explain the architecture of your app, how you specifically used Gemma 3n, the challenges you overcame, and why your technical choices were the right ones. Its primary purpose is to prove to the judges that your video demo is backed by real engineering.

- <strong> Public Code Repository (The "Source of Truth"): </strong> Provide a link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, Kaggle Notebook). The code must be well-documented and clearly show the implementation of Gemma 3n. This is non-negotiable and will be used to validate the authenticity of your project.

- <strong> Public Project Link (The Live Demo): </strong> A URL to your working product or interactive demo. This allows judges to experience your project firsthand, if applicable. It should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall.
