## ðŸ§  Problem Weâ€™re Solving

Children with dyslexia often struggle to decode written text, especially in traditional learning environments where support tools rely on typing, reading, or internet access. Many educational apps require constant connectivity, assume reading proficiency, or lack real-time, accessible feedback. This creates a frustrating learning gapâ€”especially for children who need spoken support but can't type or read fluently. There is currently no offline, AI-powered tool that lets dyslexic children independently engage with printed material through voice and vision.

## Project Overview [What We are Building]:

An offline (PWA) mobile/web application that leverages Gemma 3n (AI) to assist dyslexic children by reading sentences, terms and definitions aloud using an offline TTS engine. The app functions without an internet connection, reading predefined terms and definitions from a local data source and providing natural, kid-friendly speech output.

## ðŸ§­ Why This, Why Now? (Our Problem IMPACT Statement)

AI offers a unique opportunity to bridge accessibility gapsâ€”transforming static text into interactive, voice-driven experiences that empower dyslexic children to learn on their own terms, without shame, pressure, or the barrier of constant internet access. With tools like Gemma 3n, Piper, and local-first architectures, we can finally design educational solutions that are context-aware, speech-enabled, and built to function even in resource-constrained environments.

Black Women in Technology is uniquely positioned to build thisâ€”we offer enriched experiences of navigating systems not designed for us, and bring a cultural lens that values resilience, community, and innovation from the margins. By building for strategic needs of different learners, we unlock systems that work better for everyone.
This solution doesnâ€™t just teachâ€”it shows what STEM truly means: Science,   **TECHNOLOGY**, **Engineering, and Mathematics being used to reimagine equity, one child, one tool, and one voice at a time.
