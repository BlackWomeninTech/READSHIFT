            <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>Reading is a gateway to learning, but for millions of children with dyslexia, it's a daily source of frustration and anxiety. Traditional learning tools often fail to accommodate their unique needs, leading to a widening confidence gap. The challenge is to create a tool that is not only effective but also **private, accessible, and works without an internet connection**‚Äîcrucial for equitable learning in all environments.</p>
                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Our vision is to transform reading from a barrier into an adventure. We aim to build a patient, AI-powered reading companion that empowers children by giving them tools to overcome challenges independently, fostering confidence and a lifelong love of reading.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">ReadShift is an offline-first, privacy-focused AI application designed for children aged 6-12. When a child encounters a difficult word or sentence while reading a physical book, they can use the app to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li>**Read Aloud:** The app uses its camera (or text input) to capture the text. Our custom Gemma 3n model, **"Nyla,"** processes and cleans the text, which is then spoken aloud by a clear, child-friendly voice via **Piper TTS**.</li>
                <li>**Define:** The child can ask for the definition of a tricky word. Nyla provides a simple, age-appropriate explanation, which is then spoken aloud.</li>
                <li>**Spell:** The child can ask for a word to be spelled out, helping them make the connection between letters and sounds in a multi-sensory way.</li>
            </ul>
             <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">Throughout the experience, fun emoji animations provide positive reinforcement, making learning feel like a game.</p>

        Meet Nyla ü§ñ
Meet Nyla, the heart of the ReadShift experience. Nyla is our custom-built AI reading companion, created from Google's powerful **Gemma3n** model and brought to life using a specialized Modelfile within Ollama. We've designed her to be a patient, supportive, and friendly guide for children. When a child encounters a difficult word, Nyla can read the text aloud, provide a simple, age-appropriate definition, or spell the word out clearly. We have carefully programmed her with a child-safe persona, ensuring she never uses confusing formatting and always stays focused on the task of reading. Nyla‚Äôs purpose is not just to provide answers, but to build confidence and turn the challenge of reading into a joyful adventure.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4">Nylas in Action:</h2>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">When you click "Read Aloud":</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nyla's Task:</strong> We send your raw text to Nyla and ask her to "read it."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong> Her main job here is to act as a text sanitizer. Based on the rules in our Modelfile, she removes any markdown (like <code>**</code>) and introductory phrases ("The text says...") and returns only the clean, core text. We then send her clean response to Piper to be spoken.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">When you click "Define":</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nyla's Task:</strong> We send her a single "tricky" word (that our simple placeholder function picked) and ask her to "define it for a child."
    </li> Hello
    <li>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong> She acts as an intelligent, age-appropriate dictionary, creating a simple definition from scratch.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">When you click "Spell":</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nyla's Task:</strong> We send her a single "tricky" word and ask her to "spell it."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong> She generates a natural-sounding spelling response (e.g., "E. N. O. R. M. O. U. S. Enormous."), which is more engaging than just splitting the word with JavaScript.
    </li>
  </ul>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">Every technical decision was driven by the need for privacy and offline functionality. By running all AI and TTS processes locally, no user data ever leaves the device. This is essential for a COPPA-compliant children's application.</p>

                        <li>**AI Model:** Google's **Gemma 3n** (`gemma3n:e4b` base), customized with a `Modelfile` to create our persona, "Nyla."</li>
                        <li>**AI Server:** **Ollama**, allowing us to run Gemma 3n entirely on-device.</li>
                        <li>**Text-to-Speech:** **Piper TTS**, for its high-quality, offline-first neural voices.</li>
                        <li>**Frontend:** Vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring maximum performance and no complex dependencies.</li>
                        <li>**Styling:** **Tailwind CSS v4** (CLI), for a modern, utility-first design system.</li>
                        <li>**Local Server:** A lightweight **Node.js/Express** server to act as a bridge between the browser and the Piper TTS command-line tool.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">The primary challenge was bridging the gap between a browser-based application and local command-line tools (`piper.exe`). We solved this by creating a minimal Node.js server. We also fine-tuned the `Modelfile` for our Gemma model ("Nyla") to prevent markdown output and keep responses on-topic and child-safe.</p>
