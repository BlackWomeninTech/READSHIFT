            <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>Reading is a gateway to learning, but for millions of children with dyslexia, it's a daily source of
                    frustration and anxiety. Traditional learning tools often fail to accommodate their unique needs,
                    leading to a widening confidence gap. The challenge is to create a tool that is not only effective
                    but also **private, accessible, and works without an internet connection‚Äîcrucial for equitable
                    learning in all environments.</p>
                <p class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700  leading-relaxed">Our vision is to transform reading from a
                    barrier into an adventure. We aim to build a patient, AI-powered reading companion that empowers
                    children by giving them tools to overcome challenges independently, fostering confidence and a
                    lifelong love of reading.</p>
                <p class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">ReadShift is an offline-first,
                    privacy-focused AI application designed and intended for children aged 6-12 struggling with dyslexia
                    and other reading difficulties. Please review our privacy policy and COPPA compliance statements
                    prior to using ReadShift. </p>
