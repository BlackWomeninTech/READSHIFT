            <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>Reading is a gateway to learning, but for millions of children with dyslexia, it's a daily source of
                    frustration and anxiety. Traditional learning tools often fail to accommodate their unique needs,
                    leading to a widening confidence gap. The challenge is to create a tool that is not only effective
                    but also **private, accessible, and works without an internet connection‚Äîcrucial for equitable
                    learning in all environments.</p>
                <p class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700  leading-relaxed">Our vision is to transform reading from a
                    barrier into an adventure. We aim to build a patient, AI-powered reading companion that empowers
                    children by giving them tools to overcome challenges independently, fostering confidence and a
                    lifelong love of reading.</p>
                <p class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">ReadShift is an offline-first,
                    privacy-focused AI application designed and intended for children aged 6-12 struggling with dyslexia
                    and other reading difficulties. Please review our privacy policy and COPPA compliance statements
                    prior to using ReadShift. </p>

            <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This Privacy Policy describes how Readshift‚Ñ¢Ô∏è by Black Women in Technology, ("we," "us," or "our")
                collects, uses, and protects the personal information of children and parents who use the ReadShift
                application (the "App"). The ReadShift App is designed to help children with dyslexia improve their
                reading skills and functions. ReadShift was designed as an offline-first application in an effort to
                protect the integrity of the learning experience for children and parents alike.

            <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                We are committed to protecting the privacy of children and comply with all applicable privacy laws,
                including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States and the General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union regarding children's data.

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-2">Information We Collect</h3>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"></div>
            We collect information directly from parents/guardians and, with their consent, limited information about the child.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"> a. Information Collected from Parents/Guardians:</span><br>
            Account Information: When a parent registers for an account, we collect their email address, name, and password.
            Payment Information: When a parent subscribes to the App, we collect necessary billing information, which
            may include credit card details, billing address, and other payment-related data. This information is
            processed securely by our third-party payment processor and is not stored directly on our servers.</li>

            a. Information Collected from Parents/Guardians:
            Account Information: When a parent registers for an account, we collect their email address, name, and password.
            Payment Information: When a parent subscribes to the App, we collect necessary billing information, which
            may include credit card details, billing address, and other payment-related data. This information is
            processed securely by our third-party payment processor and is not stored directly on our servers.
            Communication Information: Records of communications with us, such as customer support inquiries.
            b. Information Collected About the Child (with Parental Consent):
            Child's First Name: Used to personalize the App experience for the child (e.g., "Welcome, [Child's Name]!").
            Child's Age: Used to tailor content and features to the child's developmental stage.
            We do NOT collect any other personally identifiable information from children. We do not collect full names,
            addresses, phone numbers, photos, or precise geolocation data from children.
            c. Information Not Collected:
            Usage Data (Offline Functionality): Because the App is designed to work primarily offline, we do not collect
            detailed usage analytics (e.g., which features are used, how long the app is open) from the child's device.
            Any progress or activity data related to the child's reading within the App is stored locally on the device
            and is not transmitted to our servers.
            Sensitive Data: We do not collect any sensitive personal data (e.g., health information, racial or ethnic
            origin, political opinions, religious beliefs).
            2. How We Use the Information
            We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:
            To Provide and Personalize the App:
            To create and manage parent accounts.
            To process payments for subscriptions.
            To personalize the child's experience within the App using their first name and age.
            Communication:
            To send parents important updates, service announcements, and information related to their account or
            subscription.
            To respond to parent inquiries and provide customer support.
            Improvement and Development:
            To understand general demographic trends (from aggregated, anonymized parent data) to improve our services.
            To ensure the App functions correctly and securely.
            3. How Information is Stored and Secured
            Parent Data: Parent account and communication data are stored on secure servers. We implement
            industry-standard security measures, including encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer (SSL)
            technology, to protect this information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
            Child Data (First Name, Age): The child's first name and age, provided by the parent, are stored locally.
            This data is used for personalization within the App.
            Offline Data Storage: When the App is used offline, any progress, settings, or other data generated by the
            child's interaction with the App is stored locally on the device where the App is installed. This local data
            is not transmitted to our servers beyond reauthorization requirements.
            Payment Data: Payment information is handled by a PCI-compliant third-party payment processor. We do not
            store full credit card numbers on our servers, only payment verification indicators.
            4. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
            We do NOT share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose any personal information collected from children to third
            parties for marketing or any other commercial purposes.
            We may share parent information only in the following limited circumstances:
            Third-Party Service Providers: We may use trusted third-party service providers to perform functions on our
            behalf, such as payment processing, hosting, and customer support. These providers are contractually
            obligated to protect the confidentiality and security of the information and are prohibited from using it
            for any other purpose.
            Legal Requirements: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that
            such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights or property, or ensure the
            safety of our users or the public.
            Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets,
            personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction, provided that the new entity agrees to
            adhere to the privacy practices described in this policy.
            5. Parental Rights and Choices
            Parents/guardians have the following rights regarding their child's personal information:
            Access and Review: Parents can access and review the child's first name and age associated with their
            account by logging into the application.
            Deletion: Parents can remove the application from their device. The application is run offline and no child
            information is stored on servers.
            Revocation of Consent: Parents can reset or delete the application
            To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [Your Support Email Address]. We will verify your
            identity as the parent/guardian before fulfilling the request.
            6. Data Retention
            We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
            collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When
            we no longer need the information, we will securely delete or anonymize it.
            7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify parents of any material changes by posting the
            updated policy on our website or within the App, and by sending an email to the registered parent email
            address. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy
            Policy.
